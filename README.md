# MultiActions Mod
This is a mod for more personal use of what I would like to have in `VRChat`.

It servers as multiple actions for quick and easy use. And currently contains the following:
* Teleport to players
* Quit game
* Toggle camera
* Respawn
* Open
  * Avatars
  * Settings
  * Safety

# Download and use
If you want to use this mod you can download it [here](https://github.com/Tolfx/MultiActions/releases/latest/download/MultiActions.dll), you need to for the moment include ReMod core in the managed folder because using it as reference, but will be changed *probably*
